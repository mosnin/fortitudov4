/**
 * GET /api/admin/ledger — the partner ledger, computed from collected client
 * payments. Admin-only.
 *
 * Model: per payment, net = amount - partnerCut (referral cut leaves before
 * the split); each partner earns net/2 on every payment — the FULL collected
 * amount, before expenses (expenses live on the P&L only, by request). The
 * receiver holds the other partner's half until the split is marked settled:
 *   net balance = Σ over PENDING payments of (other partner's half),
 * signed by who received the money. Partner selection (by first name, other
 * admins excluded) lives in src/lib/partners.ts, shared with the receiver
 * lists.
